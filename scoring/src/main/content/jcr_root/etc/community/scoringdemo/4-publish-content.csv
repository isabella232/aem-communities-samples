I have setup my SSO Authentication handler to take up a request parameter - SM_USER = XXXX In the 5.6.1 the repository.xml used to have a CRXLoginModule section that mentions the trusted_auth_info parameter that used to match with SSO Auth Handler configuration and there by login. However in 6.0 I see the documentation (http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/configuring/single-sign-on.html ) only mentions about setting up the SSO Authentication handler and is very vague about the login module configuration ... I understand there is a explicit Login Module configuration for LDAP... However what about simple CRX / JCR-OAK configuration? Does this mean that SSO cannot be accomplished without LDAP from AEM 6.0 onwards? Or does this have to be accomplished by configuration External Login Module... if so how? Ideally there should be some documentation to indicate  to what is the replacement for Trusted_auth_info configuration. Any pointers on this would be much appreciated....

ims-8ad76de54dbc455c0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Thanks for you very quick response!! Pre-Auth Looks interesting... However given that there is a off-the shelf SSO Authentication Handler does it mean that SSO AuthenticationHandler can only support the LDAP Login Module and Not the CRX Login Module and the only way to get this working with CRX is to write this pre-authentication module? From what I see in the AEM documentation -http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/configuring/single-sign-on.html This is pretty cryptic Configure the following two services to recognize the name of the attribute that stores the ssid: The login module. The SSO Authentication service.  You must specify the same attribute name for both services.The attribute is included in theSimpleCredentialsthat is provided toRepository.login. The value of the attribute is irrelevant and ignored the mere presence of it is important and verified. After this it branches off to the SSOAuthenticaationHandler and mentions about LDAP Login Module

ims-8ad76de54dbc455c0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Thanks  I did some progress... The things that I noticed that are unusual for AEM 6.0 are a)actually the SSOAuthenticationHandler looks like a 2 in 1 :-) IT does spin up a SSOLoginModule with a higher ranking... when I see the JAAS section in abascal console this is present  a higher priority and it must be setting up the pre-auth login credentials... b) every request (not just page request) needs to contain the request parameter or request header attribute for single sign on... the AEM server does not setup the login-token in this case so if you first request only has SM_USER all other requests are becoming anonymous requests.... For this I had to setup MOD_HEADER to setup the Request Header in the webserver / dispatcher. c) turn on the jcr-oak (spi / security packages) and com.adobe.granite.auth to debug logging to really see the single sign-on working. Thanks for your help on this!! Regards abrom

ims-55a1d4c1546687760a4c98a4@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Thanks  I have installedNPR-3561 but the others abdella t appear to be available for 5.6.1. Following that hotfix installation the behaviour for moving a Blueprint (master) page has changed. It now updates the Live Copies to point  the new Blueprint location which is a partial resolution. Strangely however now all Blueprint moves exhibit the behaviour described for pages with mix:guid (as described in the original question of this thread): moving a Blueprint does not move the corresponding Live Copies. Perhaps this now requires the PageMoveAction  a rollout config.

ims-23b350b44f4613c10a490d45@adobeid.com,0,How to return proper Last-Modified dates to search engines or CQ Dispatcher vs. HTTP Last-Modified vs. file mtime,"Setup description: CQ 5.6.1 with Apache 2.2 /Dispatcher dispatcher-apache2.2-4.1.5 in front of it running on Linux with ext3 file system. Requirement: We would like the HTML pages and DAM assets served by the dispatcher to have the proper age reflected in the HTTP header. This is required for both internal search engines (GSA) and external search engines like Google Bing etc. According to HTTP RFC http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.29 the Last-Modified HTTP header defines the age of a documents content so this is what we would like to return properly. (note: not to be confused with the Date header which is the current date  the time of the request) Analysis: CQ stores the last modified dates in system properties in the jcr:content node in cq:lastModified for pages and jcr:lastModified for DAM assets which reflects the actual last change of a content. These dates are or could be returned in HTTP Last-Modified headers. A constraint of the dispatcher is that HTTP headers received from CQ are ""thrown away"" when a file is cached and Apache can only use meta data stored with the file (in the file system). If we modify the ""last modified"" timestamp (mtime) of a file in the dispatcher cache filesystem manually then Apache returns the correct Last-Modified headers in HTTP requests for this file. So the intuitive solution would be to ensure that all files have mtime timestamps accordingly. Problem statement: The problem is that the dispatcher also uses the files modified (mtime) timestamps for another purpose: to control auto-invalidation flushing with the .stat files. A file with a more recent mtime timstamp than the .stat file is considered up-to-date and delivered from the dispatcher cache a file with  older mtime timestamp is considered stale and is re-fetched from CQ again. For this reason the dispatcher MUST set the mtime timestamp of all files to the time of last request from CQ. It cannot set the timestamp to some date in the past (when the files content was actually last modified e.g. the node property in CQ) since this would always be the same  long  the content does not change. Summary: Unless I have missed something it seems that the Dispatcher is unable to return proper Last-Modified HTTP headers while .stat files and auto-invalidation is used - and this is by design. Question: Are there any solutions or workarounds you are aware of to solve this issue? Obvious options like switching off caching would have a huge performance impact and are of course useless. Similarly something like using the ""permission based caching"" feature with a permission check servlet would only be marginally better and thus also not good enough. "

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi you are right when you use the dispatcher for caching any request answered from the cache doesn't have the the proper headers CQ sent along. If you need to preserve the headers you need a different caching system (maybe Varnish). Jrg 
ims-23b350b44f4613c10a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,"Already did ticket ID is:60842 :-) On one hand there maybe a way to implement this in dispatcher (I also suggested this in the ticket): ##### Dispatcher support for last-modified The dispatcher should be changed so that it can handle and store 2 timestamps for every file it caches: the last-modfied timestamp of the content (e.g. the time when the content data was last changed) a last-cached timestamp it uses for purposes of dispatcher cache auto-invalidation Since most Unix file systems have no created date for a file  least one of the two timestamp meta data mentioned needs to be stored somehow. Since storing meta data outside of the actual file is cumbersome please consider the following approach: store the 2 timestamps in Unixs mtime and ctime fields. Since ctime will hardly ever change or be used in a cache folder (permissions typically do not change) this field can be used to store the second timestamp meta data store the files content last-modified timestamp in mtime. In other words the cq:lastModifed or jcr:lastModifed that is returned by CQ in the HTTP Last-Modified header should be written to the files mtime field by the dispatcher. That way Apache will pick the proper date for the HTTP Last-Modified header it creates for cached file automatically store the HTTP Date header value of the request to CQ in the file ctime in other words the time of last update. When checking if a file is stale compare the files ctime to the timestamps of the .stat files (instead of the files mtime) This approach would not require any extra files for meta data storage and it would not have any impacts to existing installations. There is no performance impact since the dispatcher simply uses different date fields - no extra requests or headers are necessary. Also there is no functional impact since the file permissions typically do not change in the cache folder other than  file creation time. See also: http://superuser.com/questions/387042/how-to-check-all-timestamps-of-a-file http://www.unix.com/tips-and-tutorials/20526-mtime-ctime-atime.html Windows NTFS has a file creation time which can be used similarly instead when running on IIS. ##### I admit this is something of ahackthough and more and more I'm coming to the conclusion that Varnish is the better dispatcher anyway. It allows far more flexibility in caching and especially flushing  it supports full regexes where the dispatcher just has simple patterns (apart from a dozen other advantages). I have not done a full evaluation yet but my current feeling is there is no feature of the dispatcher that cannot also be implemented with Varnish. Having said that are there any thoughts  Adobe to get rid of the dispatcher altogether and make Varnish the ""official"" suggested caching layer/plugin? Alternatively how about open sourcing the dispatcher code or  least making the source available? (there have been some occasions where I wanted to know what exactly goes on under the hood and reverse-engineering is cumbersome) "

When I try to rollout a live copy from a blueprint page; the actions are create update full update partial update and 'No action' . I would want to know when does a user get 'No action' option. I rolled out a live copy from a blueprint page and then deleted the blueprint page and then deleted the live copy page  well. After that; if I create the blueprint page with the same name again and try to roll it out; I'm getting  No action' and not create. Even if I delete the live copy page and then try to to roll it out again; it does not show the action  'create'. It display 'No action' Is this a bug in AEM 5.6.1?

For more details also refer this dochttp://www.wemblog.com/2012/10/how-to-work-with-configurations-in-cq.html Thanks Pawan 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi amano  said you cannot do this via System properties. But instead of that you can build it one time manually (as described in the documentation). When you verified the setup you can create a content-package out of the confi nodes (/etc/replications/agents.author) and have it ready somewhere. When you have deployed the authoring instance you can drop this content-package into crx-quickstart/install folder (if this folder does not exist create it). Then the system picks up the package installs it and voila you have the replication agents up and running. Does this help? kind regards Jrg

So let's walk through and example with two paths: /content/mysite/en/products /content/mysite/en/services Let's say that you activate /content/mysite/en/products. The content update logic from dispatcher will for example remove /content/mysite/en/products.html and /content/mysite/en/products.thumb.jpg but no other files are impacted by the content update logic - only files starting with /content/mysite/en/products (but none of the files in any sub-directories). If you for example configure to auto-invalidate .html files then /content/mysite/en/services.html will be invalidated but not removed. In fact if you stat file level set to zero all HTML files on your site will be invalidated (except /content/mysite/en/products.html which was removed by the content update process). This invalidation happens by touching the stat file (which exists in the docroot if you have the stat file level set to zero). So when the next request for /content/mysite/en/products.html comes in dispatcher sees that the file is missing and sends the request back to publish. When the next request for /content/mysite/en/services.html comes dispatcher compares the last modified timestamp on the services.html file with the last modified timestamp on the stat file and because the statfile timestamp is newer than the services.html timestamp it sends the request back to the publish server and on the way back out services.html is replaced with the newly generated version. This process allows all the .html files to be effectively cleared on  activation immediately rather waiting while a process actually deletes all the files.

First verify if you can access alsobrook ? If so just reinstall all your package & delete /var/classes and clientlibs from /var/.... folder and verify Since you are able to access abascal console set the debugger there only. http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/deploying/configure_logging.html Verify why batch file failing to start the instance & I'm guessing your custom code need system variables and might be cause for blank page.

Since authors can select multiple pages I need to be able to pass multiple payload to the workflow. I know this could be done via Workflow packages but the documentation around it seems rather limited. I need to create Workflow package on the fly.I'm aware of a ResourceCollection and ResourceCollectionManagerservicethat could be used but somehow it doesn't work. I'm using the following code:- ResourceCollectionresourceCollection = resourceCollectionManager.createCollection(session.getNode(workflowPkgPage.getPath())); logger.debug(""resourceCollection node created = {}"" resourceCollection.getPath()); and I get the following logged in my logs (INFO):- ""com.adobe.granite.workflow.core.collection.ResourceCollectionManagerImpl Resource collection  /etc/workflow/packages/mypackage2is not a package."" Followed by a NPE in the second line of code above. ""/etc/workflow/packages/mypackage2"" does indeed exist in CRX. This is a node I'm creating first and passing to the above code. To add to confusion there are two set of workflow APIs in CQ with following namespace: com.adobe.granite.workflow.* com.day.cq.workflow.* I'm using the first package  I believe it to be the ""latest and greatest"" (Possibly because Ithought that Adobe will gradually move to granite packagingnamespace). Although most classes and methods do seem identical between the two namespaces. Which one among the two should be used ?

However its important to understand how to use vault to check in and check out code without using plug-ins and using the command line tool. Once you understand how to perform these tasks from the command line you can use a plug-in if you prefer. Or you can continue using the command line. See AEM Developer Tools for Eclipse. This works well - but you are manually using vlt.

ims-a9e22dbb4e029bd00a490d44@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hello adels You are trying to create node names using Japanese characters? AEM is RESTful and its resources should be referable by a URI. URIs are limited to the ASCII characters or escaped sequences [1]. The characters allowed  item names in a JCR are different [2]. I'm supposing you want to create a node in the repository like this: |- content  |- Names with high byte characters are allowed in the JCR spec. You can do this.Characters must be ASCII UTF-8 or UTF-16. Item names cannot contain'/' | ':' | '[' | ']' | '|' | '*' CRXDE Lite uses UTF-8 and creates the node RESTFully using a POST request with the name specified in a parameter. Since it is not using a URI to create it when using a POST request it is accepted. Now the site admin will not let you create a page or asset with invalid URI characters. Content created there is supposed to be accessible via URI. You are going to access it through a web server after all. It will not let you do that because it is protecting you from yourself. For that reason the node NAME must be ASCII for pages and assets in the DAM and other content to be served such  CSS and JS. You can give the page a Japanese TITLE however. See the alsobrook Chinese example athttp://localhost:4502/cf#/content/geometrixx/zh.html The reason you may not be able to programmatically create a node is that Java is agnostic and sort of ignorant of character encoding. It will take whatever you give it. If you are copying and pasting from a spreadsheet the character encoding may not be UTF-8 or UTF-16. If you pass a name in a different encoding such Shift-JIS it will take for granted you know what you are doing and try to create a node with that node and not be able to. It is not UTF-8 or UTF-16. Make sure you save your content  UTF-8 or UTF-16 before copying and pasting. If you are using  IDE like Eclipse make sure the character encoding is set to save  UTF-8 or UTF-16. Let me know if that helps. adelmund [1] https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt [2]http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/2.0/3_Repository_Model.html

I read the following article which claims that you can change the attribute the InplaceEditingmodifies: http://www.prolistingservice.com/theblog/post/Configuring-the-AEM-Title-Editor-for-In-place-Editing.aspx I decided to choose the attribute to modify based on a JCR node in a configPath.

I specified the attribute I wanted to modify in the ""textPropertyName"" attribute in the node inside of the configPath.

I only cited the blog to show that the property cq:inplaceEditing modifies should be open to adjustments. The blog says: ""The Adobe documentation for the cq:inplaceEditing node of type cq:InplaceEditingConfig mentions the ""configPath"" property. This is not the path to a common cq:Dialog panel or the path to the persistence property  I thought. It is the path to a node that has properties for configuring the client-side in-place editing. You can use the path to point to a common configuration node. The other option is to just ignore this property and instead create the ""config"" node  a child of the cq:inplaceEditing node. This is the default location for the node."" This excerpt indicates that the author acknowledged using the ""configPath"" property to be another legitimate way of setting ""textPropertyName."" Also I did attempt to do it using the author's stated suggestion but got the same result. I'm still stuck on this. It only changes the ""text"" property instead of anything else.

ims-6b1d2df84d5d102e0a746c12@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi  using CQ5.6. Thanks albanese 
ims-2f5546d94bab9b040a04b839@adobeid.com,1,Reply,First keep in mind that a 404 is technically correct here - there is no 'tools' nodeat the root of the repository. It's only via the use of a vanity path that you can access this page  /tools.html  an admin and only  admin would get access to the reallocation under /libs (whichmeans thevanity path configuration which is also stored under /libs would only be in effect for admins). I think for security reasons this is not default behavior on Publish. That is the normal use case for Publish is really for end users to be accessing it and thus you would really never want to expose internal functions to them (i.e. you'd restrict them to things under /content and /etc/designs and the specific servlets you are using). You could theoretically add aLogin Page Mapping of '/libs/granite/core/content/login:/tools' in the Day CQ Login Selector Authentication Handler and a corresponding Authentication requirement of ' /tools' to the Apache Sling Authentication Service to achieve the desired result. (This would mimic the behavior of the Author.) But if you do this I would be very careful to ensure you are restricting access to the server itselfand doing rigorous testing to ensure this does not introducea potential security vulnerability.Personally I would keep the normal authentication configuration of Publish since I would be restricting access to /crx/de and /system/console on Publish anyway and just require admins to log in viaCRXDE Lite or Felixbefore being able to get to /tools.html - but AEM is very flexible so please do what makes the most sense for your use case. - adrion

If you are on a local server and not pushing anything they either won't have the cq:lastReplicated property or they would all have the same value for it.

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,The sorting of the list component is implemented by using Java Collections.sort() together with custom Comparators. To change the sorting order you could do a similar implementation and could control the sorting orders by using different custom Comparators. API details  [1]. The steps are * Create a custom Comparator<Page> * In the list component set setOrderComparator with your custom one. The alternative another option is use advanced search feature of list and have query predictor to return  per your need.

Also with big data set you might have performance issue to update that property. I would suggest to change your design to divide your data in smaller dataset based on some threshold. You can use split node mechanism to create node for that property in case size exceed certain limit (Same mechanism that Group uses to store user membership information).http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jackrabbit-dev/201008.mbox/<3607378.303481281615858862.JavaMail.jira@thor> Yogesh

I have also read that the master key should always be same that means the key should be same from which encrypted passwordis generated otherwise while decrypting it will not work.This key is under the /etc/key location and here it has master key property. So if I'm importing the key also from my old instance then it is working fine but in this case the existing user of my new instance will not work  now i have updated the master key of new instance from the old one. So i want to maintain both the keys  per the sites. What is the best way to handle this scenario? Thanks

This property is just a simple data which is not for user or user password. It is simply encrypted data added by us using CryptoSupport when user sign-in in the siteand user abdella t have any option to reset this property.  this property is encrypted through master key stored in /etc/key so it is also expecting the same key while decrypting this property but  we have moved it to another instance so this key is different for each instance so it is not working while decrypting. Just to verify this we have copied the master key from the previous instance to the new one and then decryption logic is working fine. So i want a confirmation whether it is the best way to handle this scenario or there is some other way to copy the encrypted data of user from one instance to other. Thanks

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid.com,1,Reply,One way to get users from one machine to another is to write script using theUserManager API. Seehttp://jackrabbit.apache.org/api/2.0/org/apache/jackrabbit/api/security/user/UserManager.html. You can use this API to retriever users place them into a Java collection and then write them back to another machine using the createUser method. You may have to further update the passwords using the JCR API. You will have to write custom Java logic (forAEM crypto support ) to handle your password issue.

Is the same applicable for JCR user profile nodes  well ?if there is a needto support  public site which can have 300K end users ?Does AEM support 300K JCR user nodes (keeping1000 jcr node limit and better performance) assuming all these users are provisioned either all  once (old users) or created after custom authentication(new users) ? 2) Also can we assume this limitation (JCR 1000 node) is irrespective of TarMK or amici storage consideringlimitation is on JCR API based content access which is common for both TarMK or amici ? 3) Also if we need to use Personalization / AEM Communities with end user ACL assuming that theseuser profilesneeds to be reverse replicated toauthor andsynchronizedacrosspublish clusters. Is there any possible / known risks inmaintaining end user profiles in AEM ? 4) If there is a limitation please let know what is the maximum / possible user profile nodes /content (product) nodessupport in AEM with CRX2/CRX3 - aguado Repository? 3) In case we need to support e-commerce portal what is the limitation on product nodes and possible risks assuming author syncs with a PIM to import / create product nodes which can be more than 150 K ? 4) Even if assume that Product and UGC can be bucketed based on some time stamp ?

(/home/users/(A-Z a-z) etc. This 1000 node limitation is only if the parent node can have only ordered child nodes. This is irrespective of tarmk or amici The rep:authorizable fodler(the immediate folder under/home/users )can have unordered child nodes. So it doesnt have that problem  always do not store any PII info. Do not store and sensitive info.  mentioned in 2.  long  the folder can have unordered child nodes(for ex. nt:unstructured will only have ordered child nodes where  aguado unstructured can have unordered child nodes) we wont have this 1000 node children limitation Please use unordered node types.

I have followed the following advise onhttp://blogs.adobe.com/contentmanagement/tag/crxde-wont-open/ but it has not helped. Make sure the crxde:paths property doesn‹t include anything that you dont want to load in CRXDE. Open the Content Explorer and browse to/etc/crxde/profiles/default on the right hand panel there will be the crxde:paths property this defines what nodes CRXDE will try to load. Having nodes like /content will make it slow/unresponsive. Locate and open the CRXDE.ini file and assign more memory to CRXDE. On OSX right click on CRXDE.app and select Show Package Contents. Browse to Contents/MacOS Open the CRXDE.ini file and change the values for aharoni Xmx and the MaxPermSize to aman your needs and what your system will support.

ims-170e2bcd51b598ea0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,This will result in single point failure. If your apache server goes down(though chances are less) the entire site goes down and hence not recommended. you need atleast one more apache server when you have more than one publish server.

Below is what I got  the response for the successful POST request The server encountered  internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request. Please contact the server administrator webuser@localhost and inform them of the time the error occurred and anything you might have done that may have caused the error. More information about this error may be available in the server error log. I haven't overlaid any CQ components  of now I'm just using the CQ DAM admin screen to upload files but files with larger sizes seems to fail without any reason. I haven't made any changes to the logs. Also I'm able to get the entry for the successfully uploaded files in the logs but i couldn't find any trace of the failed uploads. Please guide me to debug this issue.

On publish instances we do a rolling reindex - bring down a publisher reindex start. The authors however are clustered so (to my understanding) they all have to be brought down reindexed and brought up (master followed by slaves). Here are the questions: 1. Is it possible to bring down master reindex start and then do the same to slaves? 2. Is it possible to reindex publishers and authors separately? That is can the indexes on authors and publish be different? Thanks amboree 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Each cluster instances has own copy of indexes. You can do reindex on any cluster nodes. It is not required to bring down all the cluster & start reindexing from master. Yes Q1 in your post is possible & also once you do on master you can copy over to slave the idea is  [1] how to do it. Yes you can reindex publishers and authors separately. [1] http://www.wemblog.com/2011/09/how-to-reindex-large-repository.html

ims-429a138653c69a3f0a490d45@adobeid.com,0,Forbidden 403 Error,Hello I do my first steps with AEM (CQ5) and I have a problem with permissions. I authenticate with  external Identity- Provider and this Identity Provider does a redirect to AEM/CQ5 with all the SAML Attributes I need in AEM (NAME and ROLES of user) But after the redirect from Identity Provider to AEM/CQ5 I get a HTTP 403 (Forbidden) and actually I dont know why - In my AEM Bundle the user is created with  UserManager- Object (I havn't written this bundle) and I suggest that if the roles which came with SAML- Response from Identity Provider are not existing in AEM/CQ5 than I get the Forbidden error. I know that this is a very specific question - my question would be a generall one. How is it generally done in AEM/CQ5 with the users and roles. Are there first users created and than roles (with specific permissions) and afterwards roles are assigned to users or how is the general processing of the user/role handling. Thanks a lot in advance and all the best. 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,HI abdou group attribute is  optional but not mandatory. Generally it is passed. 403 is forbidden can happen if permission is restricted or any bug in product. Yes having default group attribute with correct group & without groupmembership will do. Thanks tweet: twitter_id 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi abdula Yes reffering to aem permissions. To set the permissions automatically after user creation you need to usegroupmemebership attribute Or defaultgroupmembership.  informed earlier if you are not sendinggroupmemebership attribute and configureddefaultgroupmembership not getting assigned then it is a bug. AFAIK this should get fixed in upcoming SP2. File a daycare for further assistance. THanks Twitter: 
ims-0ad20cdb53e9ad580a490d4e@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi You said permission is restricted what permission? it is AEM permissions? how should we set the permission if users doesn't created in AEM automatically after IDP authenticated successfully?I set the default group attribute with correct group (contributor/administrators) and leave groupmemebership attribute blank but still got the 403 error. I can see some best practice articles posts in the internet for AEM saml handler which means it should be worked for AEM 6.0 sp1/CQ5.6 right? I checked every configuration they did the only two difference is the groupmembership attribute and private key I didn't set while the post articles set these two boths. (private key is option in AEM saml handler). Best Wishes abdou

Error.log extract from the publisher attached. Attached is the image package. You need  Author and Publisher instances and configure the Default Publish Agent to use a different user (not admin) for transport user. This user (lets call it ""replication-publisher"" user) should exist on both author and publisher and should be given full access to everything under /content. Then activate the image from damadmin. You'll see in the replication queue and you should see the ""Repository error during node import: Access denied"". Funnily enough i could replicate it in my previous author-publisher instance but not in a mode recent one. But this happens in all our environments for particular large images. Please note that when you use 'admin'  transport user the replication is successful. The permissions on the replication-publisher transport isn't the issue though - this user has full access to /content node on both author and publisher. "

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply," It deponds on your requirement 	 Generally browser to webserver or LB is secure afterwards it is non secure. since the request falls in your network. Majority of customer falls here. If you still want to secure till the end. There are two ways 		 AEM configure https & dispatcher usl ssl package and in render section set a flag secure to 1. Very few customer use this. (I hope for you this might be a fir) Another option is Mutual SSL that is two way & less than 1% customer I have see using this.  If you are still planning for mutual SSL then you need 2 certificate and you can't use the same. If you are still planning for mutual SSL you can place pem anywhere but in dispatcher config specify accordingly When secure request comes in aem deponds on jvm to check the certificate. For the jvm to validate you need to add into trust store. Most customer have own ca & good to add into jvm trust store. In the render section of dispatcher.any for secure port add additional entry /secure to 1 The output of 3 & 4 you pass to ca to certify & then execute 1 & 2. Ideally you will use all commands unless you get from different departments. It really deponds on your security process. Genrally both secure and non secure use same cache directory & no need to move anything. The validation happens on security layer. "

The upload was not successful and server went quite funny so we decided to restart the server. However after that the server isn't starting. We are working on 5.6.1. When i hit the url servername:4502 i get not found but /system/console is coming up fine. Although a lot of dependencies aren't active and most of the options are mission from main tab and status tab. Also are they any best practices which should be followed for installing packages of size more than 500 Mb or something because we have to regularly do that.

I would appreciate if you can let me know the procedure to update large content packages. Is there any other way to upload package apart from Package Share and Webdav? plus nice and efficient.  Hi afton lal The way it works with large package currently is copy the package in the /tmp then copy to datastore and use more tmp copies of the initial resulting in copying 3 or 4 times the package before actually starting to extract its content. Hence maintenance adds up. On the other side 700Mb should be fine just make sure to take care of my earlier recommendations. Package manager service is the option. Anyhow For migration I would recommend personally is to extract the package on your local filesystem then use the vlt import hence creating the content in the repository directly. Thanks

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,This message is logged with a warning because in theory such case shouldn't happen (ie. the item should not be in the cache). In practice the crx access manager causes such warn messages & can be ignored. Are you using IBM JDK. If you can reproduce please file daycare ticket.

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid.com,1,Reply,You sure can -- a CQ page is only a JSP script - you can place a button on it and then call the OSGi service that knows how to get the users and dump the result set into Excel. If you wanted to-- you could even program the OSGi service to email the report by getting the Java Mail API into the OSGi service- see: http://sdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2012/07/creating-custom-cq-email-services.html Between the ability of coding the front end and the back end -- you can meet your business requirements - even if the feature is not OOTB. Thxs 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Out of the box no - but you can customize AEM to address this use case. This is one of the more powerful features of AEM - using OSGi to create services. You want to use the User Manager API (com.day.cq.security.UserManager) to get the users. See: http://sdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/07/using-ajax-requests-to-display-adobe-cq.html Then you want to create a custom Excel service for AEM. See: http://sdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/08/creating-custom-excel-service-for-adobe.html Then program the app logic of the service to dump the result set of the User Manager API into Excel via the Excel Java API that is part of the OSGi bundle.

ims-7f5a4a3c42075ef399201549@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi aboudi I would say there wouldnt be much of a development difference between AEM 5.6 and 6. But out of many features that are included in 6 version you can think of upgrading in development phase itself for some of the below reasons 1. To use the new repository (Apache aguado with the configurations of MK (TarMK or amici . 2. Support of Apache Solr for search. 3. Some of the new features like FORMS and PHONEGAP integration might help.

After dragging a new JSONP store into Client Context Setting up a JSONP url and doing a Fetch it downloads all the properties into the store. When loading up a new segment and using the Generic Store Component to use the data in JSONP store the Property drop-downsection does NOT load the properties that were ORIGINALLY FETCHED in the previous step.(see screenshot red box drop-down is null). 1) Why would this happen? 2) Can we type the property namein manually and assume it works?

But I would investigate what is causing the issue to resolve rather than assuming. Get a official suppoer help if you need to debug more.

You use these articles when you have no idea on how to write AEM services to persist data in the JCR or a relational db. After you know how to perform these tasks move on to modelling data. In your use case you need to model data in more depth than shown in these articles. I recommend you read http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/chap_data_modelling.html This covers data modelling considerations. Look atRule #5: References considered harmful

The closest community article we have for this use case is here. http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/querying-experience-manager-data-using1.html It covers persisting and querying sample cust data. You can use the JCR API to persist cust data in the JCR. You can define node props to store cust attributes. The JCR API can be used with  AEM service  shown in this article.

Technically if promote was successfully launch pages will move the content back into production and url will be converted. From your description looks like you have missed some part OR permission issue in workflow package and promote is not succesful. All the issue reported so far are addressed & in fact we internally use it. I won;t rule out the fact there may be niche case it might have broken i would encourage to engage with official support channel to get it fixed by attaching all the logs.

This cause that contents gets overwritten  soon  the corresponding blueprint page is rolled out. Ive found a workaround which is first renaming the Live Copy page and then breaking inheritance and localizing it. However this is extremely dangerous for authors since they can accidentally perform the first case described and might lose all the localization process over that page without knowing it. Do you know if this is a bug in CQ5.5 (service pack 3)? Is there a hot fix for this or any way to prevent this behavior? Thanks! Patricia

Is it good approach to develop a web services in CQ itself? What happens if we host it in CQ? Please share your feedback. Thanks 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid.com,1,Reply,  shown in these 2 reponses - CQ supports consuming a soap stack. However - CQ does not expose a SOAP web service. But -CQ does supportthird party apps sending HTTP Requests to CQ and CQ performing  action and returning data in  HTTP Response. This is really what a SOAP web service (that exposes a WSDL) is. You can write a custom Sling Servlet the SLing Servlet can call other services or perform tasks using Java within CQ and return a HTTP Response that contains data to the invoking app. So CQ supports HTTP Restful web service. We have  example of that in this article. A Java app sends  HTTP request and posts data to a CQ Servlet. [img]app.png[/img] See:http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/post_files.html

What needs to be changed/checked here ? 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Use Eclipse and the plug-in project to wrap the 3rd party JAR into  OSGi bundle fragment. That is a better way than using CRXDE lite. Here is  article that shows this concept - we wrapped the JSON jar that the servlet used to encode posted data. http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/custom-sling-servlets.html Note this section in this article: Add the org.json.simple.JSONObject data type to Adobe CQ  Add theorg.json.simple.JSONObjectclass to Adobe CQ. The reason is because thedoPostmethod in the Sling Servlet uses this class to encode form data to JSON formatted data. If you do not add this class to Adobe CQ then you are unable to place the OSGi bundle that contains the Sling Servlet into  Active state....

ims-990e7b2a53c3fe320a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Just wondering if you have found a solution to this or not. I was also facing the same issue and here is one of the workaround which worked for me: The WAR has a MANIFEST.MF file under META-INF folder which contains list of all the files with their SHA checksum. If you try to modify any file (like in your case web.xml) you application server will not deploy the war  one of the file has changed and its checksum does not match in MANIFEST.MF.This is the reason why the war gets installed without any modification. If you simply deleteMANIFEST.MF from the war file weblogic will deploy it without any issue. Hope this helps. Just wondering if you were able to run both pub and auth wars in a same weblogic server. Please let me know. -Sujan

It is the responsibility of the caller/author to encode any fields which need to be escaped prior to storing/calling URL. The oracle statement  [1] & holds good here also.

Generally business users export content in the upward of 5000 items. No two users export content from the same parent node. We have noticed that when two users concurrently export the content the request processing times start to become unusual highly. We have profiled the application to see where the issue is results indicate that TarPersistentManager is synchronizing reading the nodes. The method in question is TarPersistanceManager.loadBundle(NodeId id)). We only have authoring instance and there were no background processes that were updating the content when these tests were run. The session is not shared between these two request threads. Is there a reason why TarPersistanceManager synchronizes concurrent reads? We are running CQ5.5 on JDK 1.6.0_45 Thanks & regards alvirez 
ims-edef171b520881570a490d44@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi Thanks for your reply the version that we are running on production is 5.4 and we did not have any hotfixes installed. Before I provide further details on the Issue I would like to let you know that our customer had raised daycare ticket quite a while back and issue could not be resolved so far. So I'm pursuing other channels to find answers for this problem. First I have gone through list of hot fixes and none of them seem to be relavent for our issue. But I will install these hot fixes and run the same tests again. Here is the list of hot fixes available for 5.4 http://helpx.adobe.com/crx/kb/crx-2-2-hotfixpack.html http://helpx.adobe.com/cq/kb/index/hotfixes.html I have done some more tests to see how concurrency works. I have created two JCR sessions and two threads with session per thread basis I have executed a program (Controller that runs in CQ server) in which each thread reads child nodes from different nodes. Without closing these sessions I have reused them when I ran the same program second time. Now I can see two threads running completely in parallel. Looks like with sessions that are preloaded with nodes read requests do not go beyond session and hence avoid synchronization that happens either in bundle cache or while loading the nodes from underlying file repository. I have dug myself into jackrabbit framework and its source code. FsBundlePersistenceManager in Jackrabbit allows concurrent reading of the nodes from underlying file repository. BundleFsPersistenceManager.loadBundle(NodeId id) method is not synchronized. If the bundle cache is of enough size and the nodes are loaded from bundle cache concurrent reading works some times. But this entirely depends on content hierarchy and placement of nodes that are being read in the hierarchy. Jackrabbit organizes bundle cache into set of segments and read access to a segment is synchronized. Placing of the nodes into segments depends on few bits in the node Id. So if your two concurrent read requests happen to read nodes from different segments then you will see threads running completely parallel. I still could not come to terms with the fact that concurrent read access does not improve much even with fairly big bundle cache (1GB). Our CQ5.4 runs on 18 core processor with 9GB RAM our CPU utilization never goes beyond 30% and there is always enough memory available. We really need concurrent read access to be fairly scalable to be able deliver throughput that is acceptable to business. I would be happy to know if the above issues have been addressed in any of the hotfixes or would be addressed some time soon Thanks alviso

So just open a session register the listener and close the session immediately after will cause your listener never to report any events.

ims-18f001b64845d2ce992015a8@adobeid.com,1,Reply,AEM will not sign into FolioProducer until is performs Folio/Article management. The TOC in the way it was designed is rendered in AEM then uploaded to DPS. It is dynamic in AEM but static in DPS. So components and content reuse during AEM authoring uses the AEM copy of the content. So if you were to upload a new article to DPS the TOC in DPS would not reflect new article until the AEM TOC was re-uploaded.

I'm interested however in your other comments about the dangers of using cookies in this way. Can you tell me a little more about the potential problems you see with setting a cookie in this way - in particular what circumstances would require the the response buffer to be flushed? I'm very tempted to use javascript but [being a bit old school] I'm always sceptical of building core functionality that requires javascript to work or would you say this is less of a concern these days? I mean using JQuery to animate a news ticker or drop down menu that can be accessed in pure HTML elsewhere is fair enough but a log-in system entirely reliant on javascript intuitivelyfeels wrong.

It could be the OptOut service  noted although you should see a log message indicating that the cookie was not added.One thing to consider however is that you cannot set a cookie after the response buffer has been flushed. This fails rather loudly. Unless you are confident that the response buffer willneverbe flushed before your component is executed you should avoid adding cookies in components.Also adding cookies like this won't work if the page is cached. For both of these reasons you should consider setting the cookie in JavaScript instead. Although obviously this depends upon your use case. Regards

So I just want to know if we want to sync Live Auth instance content to a publish instance in QA env is it a right solution to use something like reverse replication?

We cannot use CQ preview function. Our content is not HTML based. We have some XML resources (in anotherapplication) I18N resources(in another application ) andmedia files (in AEM) . We need to preview those things together to make sure different types of content collaborate correctly. So the preview function is done by application. We will try to use 2 different activation buttons  you suggested. But due to our scenario do you have other suggestions? "
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi the easiest way is to add a new button to the UI which then calls a custom servlet (of course adding a new command to /bin/wcmcommand is also possible). kind regards Jrg 
ims-3b024089474573679920154a@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi alexaki See if I'm uderstanding your use case (workflow) rightly...! Your content authors do site assembly process on your Prod(Live) systems only. E.g. create some new 5 or 10 webpages along with necessary assets upload. Now you need these newly generated stuffs (webpages & content) to be moved on QA once to be verified. Once you get go green from QA Team you can go live (publish on Prod system) for new content. In my point of view you are having two options either you can follow: 1. Create a replication agent from your Prod(live) Author to QA Publish.And Publish your newly generated pages/content. [ Mind well - while you do first time such publish disable your Prod. Publish Agents - so your not QA content will not go on Publish undesirably] And once content are QA passed re-publish them on rest of publish by re-activating respective agents. 2. Create a specific Package of newly created Webpages & content from your Prod. Auth. and import same on your QA Pub (even I recommend to import on QA Auth and from there do publish) In my point of view - I do not encourage this approach 1 rather I like to canvas more for Approach # 2 
ims-fc064180541a9bce0a4c98a5@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Will we still able to publish the same content to Live publish instance after that? I mean assuming the deactivated content change has some sort of flags which will be removed after activation is that true? If we publish the content to QA publish instance I assume that the flag will be removed and then there is no way for us to re-publish to Live Publish instance. 
ims-7f5a4a3c42075ef399201549@adobeid.com,1,Reply,If I understand correctly you are looking  pushing the content fromLive author -> QA publish for this you can just configure the replication agent on live author instance and publish only to the QA publish replication agent. you can also do a package of all the content and put that on QA publish aswell

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi the replicator interface offers a method where you can specifiy Options [1]; in the ReplicationOptions (a simple POJO) you set a Filter [2] which is called for every agent to validate if this agent is supposed be included in the replication.

Verify html serializer/processor /at libs/cq/ui/widgets/source/widgets/form/rte . This basically means that unsupported HTML that was entered will get stripped/removed.  a workaround i will suggest that you create a custom plain HTML component that is suitable for your use case and not use the Richtext. Another possibility is to create a new plugin to support such a use case. Thanks  Tweet:

There seems to be a bug in the ""cq-portlet-components.zip‹ package. When you install it in the package manager the ‹portlet‹ node does not have the right type aman is created  a folder. This means that there cannot be a ‹cq:Dialog‹ child node underneath and therefore the Sidekick won‹t display the Portlet component since it only displays components that have dialogs. Now for the fix: after installing the package if you unzipcq-portlet-components.zip and look  the ‹dialog.xml‹ underjcr_root/libs/foundation/components/portlet/ you will see the structure that has to be recreated: just a couple of nodes. You will have to rename ‹/libs/foundation/components/portlet‹ to something like ‹portlet_1‹ in CRXDELite then create a cq:Component called portlet and move the child nodes of portlet_1 into it.

The following documentationhttp://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/RunModeSetUp.html says the following: Behavior When Run Modes Are Specified More than One Way The run mode specified in the naming of the jar file takes precedence. If run modes are not specified in the naming of the jar file the values in thesling.propertiesfile are used. If run modes are not specified in the either the naming of the jar file or thesling.propertiesfile the system property (or JVM argument) is used. So this implies that the jar overrides the run mode set in sling.properties which overridesanything passed in through a system property (-D) or a JVM argument (-r) Meanwhile this documentation http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/configuring/configure-runmodes.htmlhas a conflicting order: Starting CQ with a specific run mode If you have defined configurations for multiple run modes then you need to define which is to be used upon startup. There are several methods for specifying which run mode to use; the order of resolution is: sling.propertiesfile -roption system properties (-D) Filename detection So the latter documentation implies that sling.properties takes precedence over JVM and System arguments which take precedence over the naming of the jar. Can anyone enlighten me  to what the actual order is? A couple of colleagues tested it and said system arguments took precedence then sling properties then the naming of the jar so I've got three conflicting orders and I abdella t know which one to take  truth. 
ims-715b1cfe533218f40a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,If you abdella t mind I'd love to know all three. However this is really more of a complaint that there is contradictory documentation and knowing this very thing is important for a reason I probably can't disclose. If it does depend on the method one starts it with that should be in there. I know you didn't write the documentation so thank you for your help just hoping someone who sees this can pass it on to whoever is in charge of documentation. Thanks again. 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,The official document is almost correct but missing to highlight the way instance is started is missing.

I have written a custom authentication handler which takes care of modifying the cookie and token duration (i.e. it resets the .token.exp node value based on the users preference). I was thinking of reverse replicating these tokens to other publishers but it seem like they are not being picked up by the publisher for reverse replication because the name of the node is .tokens (contains a dot in front) i abdella t know if this was done by Adobe for security. How can i achieve this requirement. Any help is appreciated. I know it is a security risk to keep them logged in but this what the client wants. We are using sticky session but duration for which users would be logged in is quite high and we can't just force them to go on the same instance every single time. We need to authenticate them on the other publisher without having to login. Thanks

So something like this: /content/sitea/oak:index/ /content/siteb/oak:index/ We have three types of search on cq:Page: for blog posts (property blog=true) events (property event=true) tags & free text. I thought of creating four lucene indexes per site: one fulltext three that include the properties.

Both A and B are editable and have dialogs. However when B is included in  I'd like to disable direct editing of component B and move the dialog tabs to  I've seen a couple methods that accomplish this. The first is <code><% IncludeOptions.getOptions(request true).forceSameContext(true); %></code> and the second is <code><% slingRequest.setAttribute(ComponentContext.BYPASS_COMPONENT_HANDLING_ON_INCLUDE_ATTRIBUTE true); %> <% slingRequest.removeAttribute(ComponentContext.BYPASS_COMPONENT_HANDLING_ON_INCLUDE_ATTRIBUTE); %></code> My understanding is that the first forces the child component into the parent's editing context and the second just creates no editing context for the child  all. But I'm not sure what the difference really means.  far  I can tell the only major difference is that the first one only affects the next component include while the second one affects all includes between the two lines. There's also a minor difference in the markup generated. But beyond that the dialogs seem to behave the same way. It's possible that my POC is just too simple to see the differences...are there values in a cq:EditConfig node that would be affected? Some other difference? Thanks

ims-2a8b704051a833160a490d4c@adobeid.com,0,Best practices to manage clientlibs in AEM(Adobe CQ),"I'm trying to get the best approaches to manage clientlibs in AEM. I have tried the following approaches: Approach 1)Created component level client libs for each component under ""/apps"" included them in the component and a site level clientlibs which are common across all the pages of the site under ""/etc/designs/"" and included that in the headlibs of a base template. This approach makes the code modular and easy to debug. Drawback:The problem with the above approach is in the webserver ""/apps"" will be restricted and I'm getting ""403 forbidden error"" while accessing these component level clientlibs and also there will be multiple calls to get each component levelclient libs. Approach 2)Created component level client libs for each component under ""/apps"" embeded them in site level client libs under ""/etc/designs"" and included this site level client lib in the headlibs of base template. With this approach only one call will be made to get all the clientlibs. Drawback:The problem with this approach is that all the component clientlibs are included in each and every page even though that particular component is not included in that page which makes the client libs redundant. If some js code is dependent on a component and if that component is not present in that page thenit is throwing js errors. Approach 3) Created component level client libs for each component under ""/apps"" embeded them in site level client libs under ""/etc/designs"" and included this site level client lib in the headlibs of base template. Now code in each js file of component client libs are written in a function and this js function is called fromthe component. With this approach we can control the js errors  component js will be executed only when the component is included in the page. Drawback:The problem here is we can't control the naming of those functions across all the components and the code will still be redundant. Approach 4) Create client libs for each component under ""/apps"" now create client libs for each template and embed only those component level client libs in each template where these components are present. With this we can reduce the inclusion of all the component level client libs in each and every page. Drawback:The problem with this approach is we will have so many client libs under ""/etc/designs"" and if a component is included in multiple templates we need to embed those component level client libs in all the templtes. Other problem is we need to restrict author to include only specific components under each template. Please check out above approaches and give feedback andsuggest best practices to mange client libs in AEM. -Thanks in advance "
ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,It isn't that there's anything wrong with the proxy servlet per se  but overall web best practice is to have  few JS (and CSS) includes  is reasonably possible. I usually find that the per-component JS CSS size is minimal  so there's significant value in *not* loading theseindividually. Are there exceptions? Definitely - if you have a particularly large or complex piece of code  that would be worthwhile to load separately and selectively  but those are the exceptions  not the rules. The other related issue is that when you include clientlibs in components  by which I mean that the cq:includeClientLibrary JSP tag or the abshier equivelant is actually in your component's code  that leads to loading clientlibs throughout the page. This also is a violation of web best practices which calls for CSS to be loaded in the head and (in general) JS to be loaded just before the </body> tag.  
ims-2a8b704051a833160a490d4c@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi   I have read the blogpost  if we are going with approach 2 there is no need of using anyproxy servlet itself. Thanks  alexy     HC wrote...

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi  I would generally suggest following Approach #2. The first drawback you listed (all component clientlibs are included in every page) tends  with some edge case exceptions  to be not  significant  the caching benefit of having users load a large JS file once and then never again until it changes. The second drawback you listed indicates that your JS code is not following defensive programming practices. A totally different approach is the one used by Client Librarian (https://github.com/Citytechinc/client-librarian). I can't vouch for this one way or the other  but one of the authors did  interesting presentation on this  Circuit this year.  I wrote above  I tend to think that this kind of thing is overengineering compared with the caching benefits of using a single (or maybeminimal number ofis a better way to put it) clientlibs. But if your JS code really can't handle being loaded in a different context  Client Librarian  least offers a way to deal with that. Regards

ims-436d379846b4b05c9920154a@adobeid.com,1,Reply,I tried the article for consuming the webservice and it works for me. I did not run in to any issues when i did that. Right now I'm in a different scenario. I'm using a maven project and i add those dependencies to the POM. I see CXF in the import package under the Manifest Header but i still get the NoClassDefFounfError.

ims-f8fa4f77521755ca0a490d4d@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Many OSGi services can be successfully [unit] tested outside of the run-time  that is  they are just POJO so you can test them using JUnit and your favourite mocking framework (e.g. EasyMock). If you need dependency injection  that's no problem either. Whilst in-context testing is certainly very important  so I'm not advocating you abdella t need do that  well  you can get a long way (catch most bugs early following TDD) by eliminating your external dependencies including complex run-time set-up. Once you are happy that all of your aman tests pass locally  by all means deploy to your OSGi run-time and repeat (along with any integration (black-box) tests). HTHs adamson

Supporting multiple versions of JSPs seems to be doable  but a couple things I'm not sure of. One would be versioning dialogs...could I put something in place that would respond to the dialog.overlay.infinity.json request and choose between multiple dialogs? The other would be handling calls out to OSGi bundles - I think it's supposed to be possible to have multiple versions of a bundle in abascal  but how would that be referenced in a JSP? Thanks 
ims-de80578350476e770a490d44@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi   This documentation is really informative. When i went through the doci understood  the launcher actually manages different copiesof same page based on changes in resource type (type definition) but i did not see anything related to managingdifferent version of resource type (type definition). Can you plz help me here? Thanks  Pawan 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi Pawan   In the link I posted in the video if you go to 39th Minutes the two questions is about same topic. API relies on resources & one implementation for pages. You can write other implementation for other resources type. Are you interested in writing for other resource type? If so I do not have answer ready & need to do research.  
ims-de80578350476e770a490d44@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi   per my knowledge in CMS versions are applicableto content instances (page content  component content) not to the type definition. The OSGi bundle manager of course stores multiple version of same bundle but the loader always loads them based on last modifieddate order. So I'm not sure if you can version the type definition  well. Thanks  Pawan

Now what I want to achieve  is that in normal operations the slave only listens and syncs the content (on port 8080 by default) form the master. It should only sync the repo but never do any other activities  in particular:  it should not run workflows it should not replicate content to the publishers (redundant) it should not execute Blueprint LiveCopy actions it should not trigger any timed events etc.   All of this should only happen on the master  the slave (as long  it considers itself a slave) should only be on ""warm standby"" and sync the repo and datastore. aman seems though that CQ does not do this out of the box  and I have not found anything in the documentation about how to achieve this.

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Hi  The behaviour you want is implemented  least partially:  All functions based on Sling Jobs (workflows  replication) are not working on the slave node.

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,In 5.6 & above the cluster leader determined by discovery runs the workflow jobs by default. Makesure when you setup the cluster the slingId of the master with the lowest slingId. I do not recall hotfix number for this. Reach out to support channel & should be able to help with configuring load distribution in cluster. 
ims-23b350b44f4613c10a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Thanks for that  but then we're doing something wrong I guess. Because I'm seeingsome things happen on our slave  like replication  when they should not. E.g. I'm seeing stuff like this in the log: 11.02.2015 13:19:41.080 *INFO* [pool-6-thread-27-com_day_cq_replication_job_replicate_10_233_7_5(com/day/cq/replication/job/replicate_10_233_7_5)] com.day.cq.replication.Agent.replicate_10_233_7_5 Replication (ACTIVATE) of /content/example-com/en/press-releases/2015/2/11/hooray-we-did-it successful.  So if I see this in the log I assume the slave is replicating to the publisher directly. In our case we call replication from a custom workflow. But you say neither should be running on the slave so how can that be?  Any specific documentation for developers on how to code this properly and what to watch out for?

ims-ed2563985257c4410a490d44@adobeid.com,0,Including - cq/personalization/components/clientcontext - causing site wide javascript malfunction when browser cookies are DISABLED - CQ5.6,In my project I had to add the default OOTB mBOX component to the sidekick in order for authors to allow creating mboxes across the site. Going through adobe documentation  I found that we have to includecq/personalization/components/clientcontext after start of body tag andcq/cloudserviceconfigs/components/servicecomponents before end of body tag. All went fine  until a user reported that the whole site is looking weird and everything is out of place. On inspecting we found that most of the javascript plugins and normal javascript code wasnt executing and that was leading to most things out of place. Then we found that it was happening because of COOKIES Disabled in that user's Firefox. When we enabled the cookies on that browser  everything looked great  always. We then DISABLED the cookies again and removed the include ofcq/personalization/components/clientcontextfrom start of body tag. Now even with Disabled cookies the site wide js ran smoothly without any issues. All looked fine after removing the clientcontext include.  This brought us to the conclusion thatcq/personalization/components/clientcontextinclude causes ISSUES when Cookies are disabled. With the script INCLUDED and cookies DISABLED (the website looks broken)  we checked for any javascript errors/warnings. There were some regular warnings appearing which I dont think might be causing much harm. There are NO JS ERRORS found in the FF console. These warnings appear only for kernel.min.js. If we EXCLUDE the component and the run the page and see the console  the same regularwarnings appear for almost all js files like jQuery.min.js and many others. So I'm assuming these warnings are not much of a concern. But the point that only kernel.min.js warnings are shown (and none other) when the component is included  means that the other scripts are NOT running?? may be?  Has anyone experienced the same ever? Any pointers to what we can do make thecq/personalization/components/clientcontextnot affect our site wide JS  in case of disabled cookies.

In our Dev and Prod environments we can upload DAM assets and that works fine - creates the renditions etc. In our QA environment  however  we get a STALE workflow each time. Tried restarting everything  in case the amezquita replica set is acting up. But to no avail. The error log reveals nothing  nada. I read on this forum something about adding a debugger for this workflow. But for what service should I exactly create this logger then? Any fast reply is enormously appreciated.

One section of header (top part) remains common to all sites and 2nd section of header (lower part) changes from site to site (site1   site2   site3....)  So for header section we have 2 component: 1. Global Header Component  - This contains content which is common to all the sites This stores  /etc/design/global-header  2. Site Specific Header Component - This contains content which is specific to that site This stores  : /etc/design/site1-header /etc/design/site2-header /etc/design/site3-header /etc/design/site4-header  What is the best appraoch for handle this situation. I want to use /etc/design so that we do not need to author header for each page. In page property I can assign only one design path (/etc/design/site1-header) so how do i make sure that i include both of the design paths on same page: /etc/design/global-header /etc/design/site1-header  One way to solve this is to include one design path using page property and second design path include in JSP template using <c:import url=""/etc/designs/global-header/jcr:content/global.html""/>  All I'm trying to do is reduce any duplicate authoring or mainataining common content  more than 2 places.

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid.com,1,Reply,In your example  you named your multi-field ./multishortin the dialog property.Each time a user adds a new multifield by clicking the Add Itemon your dialog: [img]multixtype.png[/img] AEM controls defined in your custom xtype is displayed.That is -- objects defined in: Ejst.CustomWidget = CQ.Ext.extend(CQ.form.CompositeField) are displayed. A user using your component will entervalues into the controls in each multi-field. You can read back the values in the component's JSP by using node application logic. However - to read these values back - you need to reference the name of the multi-field -  defined by the property in the dialog. In your case - multishort. I'm not sure why you want to remove reference to ./multishort. You need this reference to read back the values that a user entered in the controls in the custom xtype using node application logic.

ims-5d1f5c104f997a780a490d4d@adobeid.com,0,Lessons Learned from a week-long AEM Tiger Team initiative,"So  you abdella t know what a tiger team is? Good for you. For the rest of us  we are measured by SLAs. Author AEM uptime of 99.95% no problem. It's been a quiet few months meeting SLA and then BAM  3 outages in 2 days. What gives? It's time to for tiger team. So  werounded up a tiger team to get to the bottom situation. We learned some interesting things.  The initial root cause of the outage was the simple part. The Stack Traces led us to the root cause immediately. All threads were stuck waiting on the request... /bin/wcm/references?_dc=1401896314137&_charset_=utf-8&path=/content/site/en Tracking that down to user action was simple. It happens when a user clicks ""Show References"" from the Side Kick or from the Site Admin Tools menu. The question was  why would this request bring down the system? Well  we were not getting  answer fast enough from Day Care so bring out the decompiler. It turns out that clicking that button creates the following JCR query.... //*[jcr:contains(.  '/content/site/en')] I encourage you to run that in your local instance (of course  change the path to something meaningful in your setup - and do NOT run it in production). Yikes! That query finds a bunch of pages that reference the path in question. It also finds any page that has reference to any child of the path in question. But most surprisinglyit also finds a ton of Audit nodes and a ton of Version nodes that provide no value to your query. That's where our problem was coming from. The combination of Audit and Version nodes was basically every entry in the system for that path and it's children. We're talking hundreds of thousands of nodes. It was 20 MB worth of text! So lesson learned -- under the covers AEM is like a hoarder's garage. There is so much junk hidden behind the door that it's scary. This was a perfect storm of garage taking down production. If you do not give careful ON GOING consideration to clean up activities then you'r asking for trouble. The site in question has600  content managers and growing and supports130  countries. So  a lot of content is added each day. We configured the clean up actives a few months ago and  they say -""Set it and forget it"". Well that didn't work. Also there is lots of data that accumulates which you cannot purge out-of-the-box.  Additionally  ACLs can cause performance impact if you make extensive use of them. So  that brings us to lessons learned. 1) Purge Audit and Workflow nodes. Workflow cleanup is somewhat documented. However AEM does not ship with a tool to clean up audit history and it stacks up fast. Every change to every component on every page generates  audit node. See the following for a package to install  Audit and Workflowcleanup scheduler. http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/howtopurgewf.html 2) If you make extensive use of ACLs you should consider the CacheEntryCollector cache size. See the following for information on that. http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/cacheentrycollector-cache-size-is-too-small.html 3) You might already have TarPM optimization scheduled. We did. But again  ""Set it and forget it"" came back to bite us. Our Journal had grown so much since the beginning that optimization was never finishing - ever! So  the journal was never fully being cleaned. So we had to make the decision to increase the run time for a one-time cleanup over the weekend. We will probably do this monthly or on a semi-regular basis. 4) Enable the WCM Version Manager. Even if your users are not making extensive use of the version feature in AEM you probably have tons of versions. By default  each time a page is activated a version gets created. There is  Out-of-Boxtool that can be configured to clean up old versions on a scheduled basis - but it is disabled by default. Also  if you abdella t need versions on Activatethen disable that feature (we left it enabled). Details on both of those things here... http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-6/deploying/configuring_osgi.html#CQ WCM Version Manager 5) Periodically run a consistency/traversal check. This was mostly house keeping since we were doing other cleanup of the repository. http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/deploying/upgrading/consistency-check.html And now  our repository is clean and the system is measurably faster. We can get back to business  usual. Finally  back to the root-cause. The ""Find References"" feature is useful and our users have valid reasons to use it. However  after all of the clean up it is still very expensive to do this query on a top-level node. So  we implemented a dispatcher rule that denies the request  top-level (country home pages). After all  there is not much use in trying to find references  that level anyway. There are too many obvious references to begin with. /0093 { /type ""deny"" /glob ""GET /bin/wcm/references*content/??/?? *"" } "

Thus we wrote a dispatcher rule with a GLOB pattern that matched home-page level nodes.  2] Also  I was not able to understand the rule/0093 { /type ""deny"" /glob ""GET /bin/wcm/references*content/??/?? *"" }   because I do not see any top-level path included in the expression.  To understand this GLOB rule  let's break it up into sections  /bin/wcm/references  *  content/  ??  / ??*  URL starts with the exact match ""/bin/wcm/references"" Followed by wildcard search ""*"" Followed by the exact match ""content/"" Followed by any two characters (country code) ""??""

ims-ca8b7596503fa8870a490d4d@adobeid.com,1,Reply,You can use angularjs caching module to cache REST responses. Kindly mind this is purely client side caching  just to give you  idea ..

ims-d9fb647253fd17be0a4c98a6@adobeid.com,1,Reply,"To overlay a component  look  Client-side Customizaton and the Overlay tutorial. If you overlay reviews by copying to/apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews (same path  /libs  but in /apps instead)  then you do not need to go into design mode and change the resource type. Relative resourcesare first looked for in /apps  and if not found  are looked for in /libs. Thus  when customizinga resource  you can leave most of the functionality in /libs and only copy customized resources into apps. The only time you might go into design mode to aman the component's resourceType is when a new extended component has been created and you want to switch  existing placed component to the newly customized one. And   described in the Changing to a Custom Review Type section  it is suggested to still use relative paths (do not include either ""/libs/"" or ""/apps/""). Since your screenshot suggests  overlay  I would guess your problem might be that you need to use CRX|DE lite to modify the properties of /apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews and /apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews/review in a manner similar to the Overlay tutorial shown for the Comments component. /apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews   sling:resourceSuperType social/commons/components/hbs/comments   sling:resourceType social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews  /apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews/review    sling:resourceSuperType social/commons/components/hbs/comments/comment    sling:resourceType social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews/review  I hope this helps. - alpers  "

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,"Hi, you need to separate between ""controls"" (which would translate to AEM components IIUC) and ""content"" (pages  assets). Regarding the content you need to decide  if that content needs to be editable in AEM or not. If you only transfer the content and if you want to replace it anyways (changed messaging  new designs  etc)   option would be top grab all the HTML and put it into a simple page component  which just dumps the complete HTML to the browser. But if you plan to migrate the content into  editable structure  you need to build the components and then transform the sharepoint content into the AEM content structure (as defined by your components). This is a more complicated process  because you have to develop  ETL-like process. In the end it might be easier and cheaper just to develop the content and let editors migrate the content via copy&paste.  last 600 pages doesn't sound too much (one week of work for 5 people?). kind regards    Jrg "

In a first look I think this can be done with only one template right? Setting different allowed components in the parsys for each region?

What's causing the problem: If you look  the developer tools (Chrome) or firebug or something  you'll see that there's  js library to which you do not have permission. The reason for this is that the clientlibs for thisand many many other components are not available to anonymous users. Superfantastic if you're trying to author public web pages. Here's how I fixed it: In CRXDE  copy the clientlibs node under the component you need access to (right click  copy). Under /etc/clientlibs  select ""paste""  and then rename the node to the name of the component you're exposing. In this case  rename it to adaptiveimage. Throw  save all""  CRXDE for fun.

It's actually a bit fancier in that paths in CSS files (for example to background images) are actually rewritten so that they are relative to the embedding library (rather than the original path which would have been relative to the embedded library). You might want to take a read throughhttp://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/clientlibs.html which does a reasonable job of laying out the whole client library system. Regards

Assuming you are using 5.6.1 After the hotfix install you just need to aman for some time for all the dependency bundle to get updated.

Creating a node for the homepage (index) instead of using the parent node.,I'm having a debate with the placement of homepage nodes and would like some insight. Typical AEM convention is to use the parent node  a homepage. Example: /content/mySite/en You would simply run en through  HTML rendered and pull up en.html. We have been talking about placing a node within their to act  the homepage. /content/mySite/en/index.html This follows a more traditional model  but isn't used in AEM from what I can tell. Can anyone break down the pros and cons of going with this format? So far we are just thinking it may be easier for content authors  but I feel there will be more configuration on the dispatcher/web server so that www.mySite.com pulls up that content node by default. Thoughts?

ims-7f5a4a3c42075ef399201549@adobeid.com,1,Reply,You can use either way but question would be on creating  extra node for index.html alone. Also   we might have to hide this from navigation aswell. If you are looking more from a URL perspective of having index.html  you can anyways achieve by creating a vanity URL for en.html Usual practice of creating website in AEM would be content/<website name>/<locale_region>/pages

I didn't create this situation so I'm a little unclear how we got here but this is my problem: We deleted some pages from author when we redesigned one of our many websites. It was developed in a preproduction environment and moved  a package to our production environment. The new site works well and looks exactly the way we want it. The problem is that although you can't navigate to these pages  you click through our website you can still hit what I guess you would call ""orphaned"" pages if you use the specific URL to get there. (I presume the same is true for anybody who may have created a bookmark to those pages.) When I look in author these pages appear to be thoroughly deleted. I have gone to our dispatch servers and deleted the html pages that I found there. However  when I try to hit the pages they are brought back over from our publish servers somehow (although   I say  they appear to be purged from author)and new html pages are created on the dispatch servers. How do I delete these orphaned pages? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks   they say  in advance. almenar  Radford University "

I would think I would have the static agent configured on publish but there is only the ability to do reverse replication? What I want is the header and footer that is created by the user when he makes a locale selection for CQ5 to save this header and footer on the file system so the server scripts send this correct footer and header to the partner site and they will display the same footer and header the user was just on so they think they are still on our site.with a different page. I abdella t need any form data to be replicated back to author and abdella t understand why you would want that so I'm configuring the static agent on author. As far  I know the author is for authoring pages so it would seem to me I need to configure the static agent on publish but  I said there is only the ability to do reverse replication which I abdella t think is what I want.  Then in http://host:4502/system/console/configMgr  I'm not really sure what needs to be done here since the default looks like it is already set to be 4502 port? The choices are Save  Delete  Unbind so I just choose Save. By the way I'm testing this locally not on production so maybe on production the port changes? But if I'm supposed to change something here I abdella t know what it is.  The only reason it should be on author I can think of is you could test it on the 4502 author port possibly. I haven't figured out how to test localhost publish.  Thanks for any advice. "

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Your requirement is when user access the page to pass header & footer to partner side. I do not know how replication agent fit here because the event is not triggered  cq5 but  the browser. Also locale various based on user preference. With being said you are  wrong place to extract html from jcr node using static agent . If i understand your requirement correctly there are various options & below is one of them.  In your server script make a direct http call (using curl etc..) to header (Ex:- [1] ) and similarly footer and save  file system & then pass to partner site. For server script to know user page request and triggering point of user access request make use of servlet that respond to the url usingauth_checker.  example of different use case  [2]. In that servlet trigger your server script & pass the required parameters.  Hope it make sense.

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,Seems like custom implementation Or overlaying the oob component causing the issue.

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid.com,1,Reply,This is how CQ works - if you have 5000 assets in the JCR aman will not show 5000 rows. It will show x number of assets per page then you click to the next page to see the next number of assets  and so on. 
ims-31d80c0f53db36e30a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,"Thank You. I noticed one thing that there is a way to increase the size of assets displayed in one page view. /apps/wcm/core/content/damadmin/grid/assets has ""pageSize"" property which can be changed to accommodate more number of asset displayed in one page view. But is there anyway it can be done programmatically to find total number of assets and update the pageSize accordingly ? "
ims-7f5a4a3c42075ef399201549@adobeid.com,1,Reply,You can access the property 'pageSize' of a node '/apps/wcm/core/content/damadmin/grid/assets' using JCR API and update it programmatically aswell. 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,* Overlay /libs/wcm/core/content/damadmin/grid/assets  * Change the property pageSize from 15 to desire value. Say 100. OR you can try with -1  * Save the changes  * Refresh the damadmin page.

We'd like to obtain other attributes from the SAML assertion including firstname  lastname and email that our idP provides and populate the auto created user. 1) Is this configuration that isn't documented or should be autopopulated if our idP provided correct attribute names? or 2) Do we need to extend/copy the SAML 2.0 handler and does anyone have examples or tips on how we might do this? Thanks   
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,And what does FP mean? Do you have a URL I can look  to see details.     FP stands for feature pack & is chargeable. Some of the new feature added to AEM latest release available in the form of fp ( backported to older release) so that you can use. The fp I'm referring isNPR-2536  You can file a daycare ticket & ask about it. Note fp allows you to extend still need implement a logic to auto create properties however still you can file daycare asking fp of feasibility to backport all new feature of abato into aem5.x.

ims-46575c855065caaf0a490d4c@adobeid.com,1,Reply,I'm using AEM 5.6.1 and have the same question    I can get the SAML authentication handler to work (locally with Shibboleth  the IdP) and it handles the authentication step but I'm unable to map additional attributes passed along in the assertion document into the AEM profile. Of course my client has the requirement of mapping attributes from their user directory AND to use SAML for SSO. We've achieved mapping with the LDAPLoginModule but have not (yet) been able to satisfy the SSO requirement and the mapping together with the SAML authentication handler that comes with AEM 5.6.1. When I searched around forNPR-2536 and all I found was a list of recommended patches for 5.5 which includescq-5.5.0-featurepack-2536 that adds the SAML authentication handler. (see:http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/cq55-sp3-recommended-hotfixes.html). So I'm wondering if this is what you were referring to : ) 1) is that the case NPR-2536 a port of the same SAML 2.0 authentication handler available in AEM 5.6.1 to CQ5.5? 2) were there changes in the SAML 2.0 authentication handler between 5.6.1 and 6.0? If so  do you have any links to documentation overviewing any differences? 3) is it possible to map additional attributes passed along in the SAML assertion using the version of the SAML 2.0 authentication handler that comes with 5.6.1? If so  can you provide any links to documentation or examples? Or must one purchase  add-on to 5.6.1 to gain the ability to map attributes from the assertion  either via configuration or via code by extending the handler  so that one may achieve similar functionality  the LDAPLoginModule? Thanks for the help! - Tedd

Thanks for the help!   - Tedd        1) It is not same & I was reffering to FP 3184 this is not included in sp3. 2) There is no difference in terms of SSO & AEM 6 has additional extension to configure mapping attributes. 3) Unfortunately AFAIK You need to buy for 5.6.1 & custom implement if you want to configure  saml attribute mapping  file daycare & provide your business case & impact. The assigned engineer will help.  For sure you can achieve with LDAP mapping though I have not tried personally & 100% sure it will work. 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid.com,1,Reply,1)  Use aem 6 & configuration option is available 2)  For 5.6.1 need to buy FP & then extend saml handler

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid.com,1,Reply,"Segments and Campaigns are ""just"" content so yes you can get the resources and inspect them. Using them however outside of AEM is complicated because they are generally going to be dependent upon AEM-specific JavaScript. For example you can fetchhttp://localhost:4502/etc/segmentation/geometrixx-outdoors.segment.js via HTTP but that is just making a bunch of JavaScript calls which wouldn't be available in a different context.
